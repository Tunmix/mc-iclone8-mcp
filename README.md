# mc-iclone8-mcp

[Français](README.fr.md)

A local MCP server for controlling iClone 8 through its official Python API.

The iClone plugin provides a small start/stop window. The MCP endpoint is local
only and defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp`. All iClone commands are sent
back to iClone's main thread before they run.

## Requirements

- iClone 8 on Windows.
- A client supporting Streamable HTTP MCP, such as Codex.

## Install the iClone plugin

1. Copy this repository folder to:

   ```text
   <iClone 8>\Bin64\OpenPlugin\mc-iclone8-mcp
   ```

2. Start iClone 8. The plugin starts the MCP server automatically at
   `http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp` and stops it when iClone closes.
3. **Plugins → mc-iclone8-mcp → Open MCP server** shows the status and offers
   **Stop**/**Start** buttons; **Start** also reloads the plugin's Python code.

The server deliberately binds to `127.0.0.1`: it is intended for the computer
running iClone, not for a network connection.

## Install as a Codex MCP server

Keep iClone open and start the server first. Then run:

```powershell
codex mcp add mc-iclone8-mcp --url http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp
```

Restart Codex (or start a new task) after adding it. Confirm the configuration
with:

```powershell
codex mcp list
```

Alternatively, add the following to `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` (or to
the project’s `.codex\config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.mc-iclone8-mcp]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp"
startup_timeout_sec = 15
tool_timeout_sec = 60
```

An identical ready-to-copy sample is available at
[`examples/codex-config.toml`](examples/codex-config.toml).

Configuration examples for Claude Code, Pi coding agent, OpenClaw, Hermes, and
VS Code are collected in [`docs/agent-configs.en.md`](docs/agent-configs.en.md).
The reusable expert skill is available in
[`skills/iclone8-mcp`](skills/iclone8-mcp).

Prompts with scene prerequisites are available in
[`docs/usage-examples.en.md`](docs/usage-examples.en.md) and
[`docs/exemples-utilisation.fr.md`](docs/exemples-utilisation.fr.md).

Detailed setup instructions for Claude Code, Pi coding agent, OpenClaw, Hermes,
and VS Code are available in [`docs/agent-configs.en.md`](docs/agent-configs.en.md)
and [`docs/agent-configs.fr.md`](docs/agent-configs.fr.md).

## Updating the plugin and clients

1. Stop the MCP server with iClone’s **Stop** button.
2. Close or reload the iClone plugin if required by the installed build.
3. Download the new version from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/gorbabor/mc-iclone8-mcp/releases).
4. Replace the complete plugin folder:

   ```text
   <iClone 8>\Bin64\OpenPlugin\mc-iclone8-mcp
   ```

   Do not mix old files from `tools` with the new release.
5. Restart iClone 8; the server starts with it.
6. Confirm the local URL and restart/reload the MCP client so it refreshes the
   tool list.

The client configurations normally remain unchanged because they continue to
use `http://127.0.0.1:8766/mcp`. Restart the client or MCP session after an
update to avoid a stale tool list. Test new experimental operations in the
installed iClone build before using them on an important scene.

## Available capabilities

The current development line adds the documented iClone 8 camera, material,
light, facial/viseme, content-browser, import, export, and thumbnail operations
to the previous `v0.1.1` baseline. The source registry currently defines 111 MCP
tools; experimental operations must still be checked against the installed
iClone build after restarting the plugin.

| Mocap and networking | `get_mocap_status`, `get_network_capabilities` | Diagnose the mocap manager and native TCP/UDP availability. |

These tools can be used to:

- inspect, select, transform, show, and remove scene objects;
- create official iClone primitives, import assets, and save projects;
- control the timeline, cameras, and lights;
- inspect and change materials, colors, texture maps, opacity, glossiness, and self-illumination;
- inspect avatar components, skin bones, animation clips, loop counts, and morphs;
- author body animation from scratch with bone keys, IK targets, reach and look-at keys;
- look at the viewport and iClone dialogs and click through them;
- load or pre-load motions, apply Substance Painter texture folders, and export a single object as FBX;
- inspect the current render size and start a render only after explicit confirmation;
- inspect iClone mocap state and native TCP/UDP availability without opening external connections.

The plugin targets iClone 8 exclusively through its official Python API.

## Example instructions for an agent

Give the agent a clear objective, object names, and numeric values. The agent
can inspect the scene first and then call the appropriate MCP tools.

| Category | Example instruction |
| --- | --- |
| Scene | “List the props in the scene, then select `MCP8_Live_Test_Box`.” |
| Creation | “Create a red box named `Logo_Block` at X=0, Y=0, Z=20, and add a floor beneath it.” |
| Transform | “Move `Logo_Block` to X=200 at frame 120 and scale it to 150%.” |
| Materials | “List the materials on `Logo_Block`, then set material 0 to royal blue and hide its diffuse texture.” |
| Texture maps | “Apply `C:\\Assets\\logo_basecolor.png` as the diffuse texture of material 0 on `Logo_Block`.” |
| Material animation | “At frame 300, set `Logo_Block` material 0 opacity to 0.25 and self-illumination to 0.8.” |
| Timeline | “Set the playhead to frame 0, play frames 0 through 300, then stop.” |
| Camera | “Read the active camera's focal length and set it to 50 mm.” |
| Animation | “Animate `Orbit_Sphere` around `Center_Cube` using transform keys at frames 0, 150, 300, 450, and 600.” |
| Avatar | “List the skin bones and animation clips on avatar `Character1`.” |
| Avatar playback | “Inspect `Character1` capabilities, then set clip 0 to loop three times at 1.2× speed.” |
| Morphs | “List the morphs on `Character1`, then set the specified facial morph to weight 0.5 at the current frame.” |
| Import/export | “Import this `.iProp` file, save the project, then export the selected object as FBX.” |
| Render | “Read the render dimensions. Only when I confirm, render the video using the project’s current iClone settings.” |
| Mocap | “Check whether iClone mocap is running; do not change or connect any device.” |

For a camera follow shot, use a real scene camera rather than the iClone
Preview Camera: “Create or activate `Camera1`, then key its transform at the
same frames as the subject, with a consistent relative offset.”
